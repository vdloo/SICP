; Both the formulas for parallel resistors are algebraically the same. But
; because the R values are intervals this doesn't work out, dividing an
; interval by itself does not result in 1 (it approaches it). Because of this,
; par2 is more accurate because by not repeating variables that represent
; uncertain numbers a tighter error bound is produced.

iterating over the items results in a reversed list because cons wraps
a pair around the provided arguments, so what you need to do in order to
the type of list that you want is to either reverse the resulting (nested)
pairs and cons an end of list marker on top of that or every time you want
to add something to the list, iterate all the way down to the last pair
and replace that with a cons with that pair and the new pair and then add
an end of list marker.
